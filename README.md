## About the Project

This project replicates the classic Tic Tac Toe game in assembly language. The game is designed to be played by two players in a text-based interface. It showcases skills in microprocessor programming, efficient use of registers, and real-time memory updates.

## Features

- Interactive two-player gameplay.
- Text-based display of the Tic Tac Toe board.
- Dynamic updates to the game board after each move.
- Victory, draw, and error detection mechanisms.

## Technologies Used

- **EMU8086 Microprocessor Emulator**: For writing and running the assembly code.
- **TinkerCAD**: For microcontroller simulation and hardware extension.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vvsndattasailingam/Microprocessor-Tic-Tac-Toe-EMU8086-TinkerCAD.git
   ```

2. Open the `TicTacToe.asm` file in EMU8086.

3. Assemble and run the program in the emulator.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## TinkerCAD Implementation

To simulate this game in TinkerCAD with a microcontroller:

- **Hardware Setup**: Use an Arduino Uno board and connect LED indicators and push buttons for moves.
- **Software**: Adapt the assembly logic to Arduino C code for compatibility.

  Developed as part of the Microprocessor and Interfacing coursework.
